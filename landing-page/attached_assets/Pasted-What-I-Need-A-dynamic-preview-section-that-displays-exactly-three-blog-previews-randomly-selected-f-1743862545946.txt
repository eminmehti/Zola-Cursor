What I Need:
A dynamic preview section that displays exactly three blog previews randomly selected from my full blog article library. This selection must update automatically once per week.

Functional Requirements:

Dynamic Blog Preview:

Display three blogs at a time.

Each blog preview should include:

A thumbnail image or icon

The blog title

A short text excerpt

Clicking a preview should redirect the user to the full blog post.

Weekly Automated Rotation:

Every 7 days, the three blogs displayed should be randomly reselected from the full library of blog articles.

This selection process should not require manual intervention and should happen automatically.

Blog Data Management:

Blogs should be sourced dynamically from a JSON data file or a simple backend setup on Replit, making it easy to manage and update the blog library.

CTA (Call-to-Action):

Below the blog previews, include a clear and engaging call-to-action button or link (e.g., "Explore More Blogs") that redirects users to the main blog page displaying all articles.

Technical Implementation Steps:

Set up a JSON file or simple database that stores metadata for each blog post (title, thumbnail, excerpt, and URL).

Build a frontend component (using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React, depending on my project setup) that fetches blog data from this JSON file or backend.

Write a JavaScript function or backend logic (Node.js) to randomly select three unique blog entries from the dataset.

Implement a mechanism (e.g., local storage or server-side storage) to remember the selected blogs for exactly one week, updating automatically after this period.

Ensure this feature is responsive, visually appealing, and consistent with the rest of the landing page styling.

Additional Considerations:

Keep performance optimized by ensuring the blog selection logic runs efficiently.

Provide clear, maintainable, and commented code so future adjustments can easily be made.

Please document your process clearly and include comments in your code for better maintainability.
