1. Overall Container & Layout
Create a section or div for the hero area that spans the full width of the screen (100% width).

Set a light purple or lavender background (for example: #f8f6ff or similar) that contrasts well with darker text.

Ensure the hero section has sufficient top and bottom padding (e.g., padding: 4rem 2rem;) so it appears spacious on desktop and remains readable on mobile.

2. Header (Top Navigation) Details
Header Container: Place a header (e.g. <header>) at the top of the hero section, usually inside the same container but visually separated or with its own container. Use flex or grid for alignment.

Logo/Brand Name (Zola):

Put the word “Zola” in the top-left corner, styled as the brand.

You can use a strong or distinct font, slightly larger than the navigation items (for instance, 1.25rem to 1.5rem in size).

Consider a bold or semibold weight to differentiate it from other text.

Navigation Links (Home, Services, The Process, Partnerships, Why UAE):

Place these links in a row (e.g., <nav> with an unordered list) centered or distributed between the logo and the CTA button.

Use a minimal, clean font (e.g., a sans-serif style), sized around 1rem with normal or medium weight.

Add some spacing or padding between each link (e.g., margin: 0 1rem;).

“Start Now” Button:

On the far right of the header, add a prominent button labeled “Start Now”.

Use a dark background (e.g., #2C2C2C or a branded dark blue/purple) with white text for high contrast, OR use the brand’s primary color if it’s consistent.

Keep the button style consistent with any other CTAs (e.g., rounded corners, hover states).

3. Main Hero Content Layout
Two-Column Layout (on desktop screens):

Left column: Headline, subtitle text, and call-to-action buttons.

Right column: Illustration showing the female character with a background analytics/card design.

On mobile screens, stack the text content on top and place the illustration beneath (or vice versa) for a more vertical flow.

4. Headline Text
Headline Copy: “AI-Powered Consulting for Relocating to the UAE”

Font Size: Large enough to be the immediate focal point (e.g., 2.5rem–3rem on desktop, scaling down to ~1.8rem on mobile).

Font Weight: Bold or black (depending on your chosen font).

Color: A dark gray or near-black (e.g., #1C1C1C or #2C2C2C), so it’s highly readable on the light background.

Line Height: Slightly looser than normal for readability (e.g., 1.2–1.3).

Subheading/Tagline: “Helping individuals and businesses seamlessly move to the United Arab Emirates with advanced technology and expertise.”

Font Size: Smaller than the headline (e.g., 1rem–1.2rem).

Color: A medium gray (e.g., #555555) for hierarchy.

Line Height: Comfortable for multiple lines, e.g., 1.5.

5. Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons Below the Text
Primary CTA: “Create an account”

Button Style:

Background color: a bold purple (e.g., #6360FF or #6D5BD0)

Text color: white (#FFFFFF)

Slightly rounded corners (e.g., border-radius: 4px or 8px).

Padding: e.g., 0.75rem 1.5rem.

Font Weight: Medium or semibold for the text.

Hover State: Consider darkening or lightening the background color.

Secondary CTA: “Learn more”

Style:

Possibly a plain text link or subtle button.

Use the same brand color as the primary CTA for the text, but with no background fill.

Alternatively, use a lighter shade of the primary color for the text.

6. Illustration / Graphic on the Right
Female Character:

The illustration depicts a woman with black hair wearing a purple top, waving.

If you have the asset as an SVG or PNG, place it in the right column.

Ensure it is responsive (set max-width to, for example, 350px–400px on desktop; auto-scale on mobile).

Analytics/Map Card:

Behind the character is a stylized card or dashboard showing a circle chart, a map of the UAE, and location pins.

Use layering or z-index to place the woman’s hand in front and the card behind.

Keep the colors consistent: Light background for the card, with simple icon shapes in the brand’s primary or secondary hues.

City Skyline Backdrop (UAE Landmarks):

A faint, translucent silhouette of UAE buildings (e.g., Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab) is in the overall hero background.

This is a background layer with low opacity (or a lighter color) so it doesn’t overpower the text.

You can place it in the overall hero’s background using a background-image (centered, no-repeat, or cover) or as an absolutely positioned SVG/PNG.

7. Spacing & Alignment
Vertical Spacing: Keep consistent vertical spacing between headline, subtitle, and CTA buttons (e.g., 1rem to 1.5rem).

Horizontal Spacing (Columns):

On desktop, a typical grid layout might have 50% width for the text content and 50% for the illustration.

Or use a 60/40 split, depending on how large the illustration is.

Maintain a comfortable margin between the left and right columns (e.g., 2rem–3rem gap).

Mobile Responsiveness:

Stack the text (headline, subheading, CTAs) above the illustration in a single column.

Make sure the font sizes scale down appropriately.

The menu might collapse into a hamburger menu for small screens, and the “Start Now” button could be displayed as a smaller icon or remain as is.

8. Typography & Color Palette Suggestions
Font Families:

Headline: A bold, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Poppins, Montserrat, or similar).

Body: A clean sans-serif for the subheading and navigation (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto, or similar).

Color Palette (approximate):

Background: Light lavender (#F8F6FF) or a very pale purple.

Primary Accent (Buttons, Highlights): Vibrant purple (#6360FF / #6D5BD0).

Text: Dark gray or near black (#1C1C1C / #2C2C2C), with sub-text in a mid-gray (#555555).

9. Final Touches & Quality Checks
Check Readability: Ensure the main headline contrasts strongly with the background.

Check Button Accessibility: The “Create an account” button color contrast must meet accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA at least).

Check Image File Sizes: Keep illustration and background images optimized so the hero section loads quickly.

Hover & Focus States: Provide clear feedback on interactive elements (links, buttons) for both mouse and keyboard users.

Typography Hierarchy: Confirm that the headline is the largest text, subheading smaller, nav links smaller still, so the user’s eye is guided properly
